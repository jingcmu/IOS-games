IOS-games
=========

This summer, we have a good opportunity to learn how to develop IOS games with Jeremy - the co-founder of makegameswith.us
We will develop several games including: game of life, flappy bird, angry bird and design a game by ourselves. 

Making games is funny, I enjoy it a lot. I share all my code and hope other people could also have funny by learning ios game development.
